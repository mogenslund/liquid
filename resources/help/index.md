# INDEX: Salza Liquid Help #

Velcome to the Liquid help system!

The help system is a collection of files with different topics.

This is the front page. You can always get back to this with the key combination
"C-h h" (Ctrl+h and the h).

# Navigate the help system
To move the cursor use

 * i: up
 * k: down
 * j: left
 * l: right

Links in the help system are encapsulated with square brackets, like this
one: [command-line-options.md]

If the enter key is pressed while inside the square brackets the help system
will navigate to that topic.

The tab key can be used to move the cursor to the next reference (the square
brackets).

 * Enter: Navigate link
 * Tab: Move cursor to next link
