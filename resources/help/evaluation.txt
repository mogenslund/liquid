                                Evaluation

To evaluate code snippets press: c p p. If selection is active the selected
code will be executed. (Be aware the selection needs to contain valid code to 
evaluate successfully.)

If nothing is selected the smallest form containing the cursor will be 
evaluated.

Examples:

    (+ 1 2 (* 3 4)) 

Place the cursor on "1" and press c p p. The result will be 15.

Place the cursor on "3" and press c p p. Onlty the inner form will be 
evaluated with the result 12.

This priciple allows one to evaluate "test" snippets within comment tags, 
like:

    (comment (+ 1 2 (* 3 4)))
