  "The slider is a basic construction resembling the most
  fundamental actions of a text edtior.

  The slider is immutable, so every slider function in this
  namespace will take a slider as input together with some
  parameters and evaluate to a new slider.

  By having the slider as first parameter a series of actions
  can be performed by using the threading operator \"->\",
  like:
 
  (->
    sl
    (end-of-line)
    (forward-char 3))

  Some of the basic operations are:

  * Moving cursor
  * Inserting and removing content
  * Setting marks and moving cursor to marks
  * Marking regions

  The sliderutil contains more slider related functions,
  which are more complex and usually composed of the basic
  functions in this file."

(defn create
  "Creates a new slider with given text as text.
  The point will be placed at the beginning.

  A slider basically consists of two lists:

  before: A list of characters (strings) before the point,
          where the first element is the character just before the point.
  after:  A list of characters (strings) after the point,
          where the first element is the character just after the point.

  So moving the point is more or less to take characters from one
  of the lists and put into the other.

  This text: abc|def

  will look like this:

      before = (c b a), after = (d e f).

  Moving the curser to the right will result in:

      before = (d c b a), after = (e f)."
